# Week 4 Game

Dr. Who variation of Star Wars Game, Homework Assignment Week 4 Game.

Game starts by selecting your charecter from the "players charecter list" and then the remaining charecters become enimies and move to the 
next lower level row below, the "enemies row", select the first enimie  that you want to fight will move to the "defender row" below in a 
3rd row with an atack button, when the button is clicked you will do battle with the enimies charecter and it will remove health points value
from both the "selected player charecter" and the "enimie charecter" until one player is out of health points value.

The game ends when the "selected player" or "enimie" dies by running out of health points value or when "selected players charecter" defeates all of the
"enimie charecters" available. 

You can view the game status as it tracks the "selected players charecter" and "enimies players charecter" name and health points value in the lower display.

You can reset the game or start a new game via the new game button.

Thank you for playing.
